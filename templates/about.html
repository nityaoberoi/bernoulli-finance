            <h2>Why Bernoulli?</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli" target="_blank">Daniel Bernoulli</a> was a Swiss mathematician and physicist who formulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli’s principle</a>, which forms the basis of modern aviation. We’ll curb our geeky side here and simply say that Bernoulli’s principle helps explain airlift and is used extensively in aircraft wing design, enabling planes to take off and stay in flight.
            </p>
            <p>
                We founded Bernoulli Finance with a similar goal in mind – <strong>that of helping your venture take off and smoothly navigate its journey.</strong> Like a plane, your business has many moving parts to manage – getting your customers on board, keeping them satisfied, managing internal inventory, steering clear of turbulence, piloting to your planned destination...and all the operational factors that support each move.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help design and run your financial engine, enabling <strong>better decision making and long term planning</strong>, so that you can pilot towards your goals in the best conditions.
